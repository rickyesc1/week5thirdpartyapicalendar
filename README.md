# Week 5 Bootcamp Homework Assignment: Work Day Calendar/Scheduling App

## Description

A functioning calendar app that allows you to save events for each hour of the day.  The assignmnet was to refactor code that was given to us, and to use moment.js to start exploring and demonstrating how web applications use time and how javascript playas a part in this.  

As commonly found in my web apps, this one runs in the browser featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS through jQuery.



## Motivation

Naturally the main motivation in doing this assignment is to excel and do well in order to get a good grade and secure a good job for a better future. 
However, I was given an assignment and understood what had to be done. I refactored the code I was given for the calendar app and played with html, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, and moment.js in order to make the application work well. 

The app was built for the purpose of the average/typical work day, from the hours of 9-5, but in the near future I would like to add a couple extra pages with the same calendar app but either with more hours, or a different type of schedule to fit the user's needs. 

## Coding Style

I would say that the coding stle of this project was on the "functional" and "object-oriented" side of things.

## Build Status:

The application is deployed and running and can be found at https://rickyesc1.github.io/week5thirdpartyapicalendar/

## Examples of Application In Use:

## Installation / How To Use:

As previously stated, simply following this link https://rickyesc1.github.io/week5thirdpartyapicalendar/ will take you to the web application and allow you to use it yourself and save your tasks locally without anyone else seeing them.

https://watch.screencastify.com/v/kBDrdD4rK5JGxROGuiOu this link will take you to a video that demonstrates how to use the scheduling app which is inherently very simple:
    1. navigate to the web app in your browser
    2. click on a time block to input your tasks.
        note: the time blocks are made to fit any amount of text, but the textbox will not expand rather if you fill the space up with lots of text you will end up having to scroll down the box to see everything.
    3. Hit the save button on the far right to save your tasks. 
    4. Hit refresh just to be amazed at the fact that your tasks are still there and have not disappearred.
    5. Lastly, GET YOUR TASKS DONE !
